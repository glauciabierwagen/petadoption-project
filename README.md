## Guidelines 

- Creation of a website that nests several pages deep, with proper project structure. Some part of your website needs to nest at least three levels deep. The page can be about anything where it is appropriate to write individual bios (for at least 5 individuals/ separate things) such as a sports team, a pet adoption, band, books in a book store, paintings in an art gallery, etc.

## The project 
- From the index.html it is possible to navigate to adopt (adopt process, adopt cats, adopt dogs located in the pages folder (level 2 nesting). 
- From cat's page, dog's page, other's page you can click on individual pets for more information (located in an individuals folder inside the pages folder).
